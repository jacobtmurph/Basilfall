## Cease-Shrine is the central continent in the world of Basilfall
It's an oblong isle seperated into three distinct political bodies: [[Places/Cease-Shrine/Celestian Oligarchy/Main Info | The Celestian Oligarchy]],  [[The Duchy of Shrinevalley]], and [[Places/Cease-Shrine/Proudmantle Lineage/Main Info | Proudmantle Lineage]], the largest of these being the Lineage. Population in Cease-shrine is mostly human,  thought elves and dwarven kin are not an unusal sight in the bigger cities.  

## The Celestian Oligarchy
Mostly made up of the Elves or some divinely imued humankind (Aasimar) inhabiting the tops of the [[Celestian Mountain Range]] in the far east of Cease-Shrine. The Oligarchy is governed by the six heads of three ruling nobles that still remain from the time [[Before Fall (B.F.)]] in the high-peek city of [[Places/Cease-Shrine/Celestian Oligarchy/Cities/Maiden's Crest/Main Info | Maiden's Crest]].  They are known to work closely, though still somewhat reluctantly with the Dwarven clans that inhabit the upper regions of the mountain caves. 

Gossip of Drow and Duregar invasions from the lower regions of the mountains have been on the rise lately, though nothing has been confirmed yet by any of the regal halls of nobility.

Rarely do any inhabitants of the Oligarchy venture out into the so-called "Lower regions" of Cease-Shrine, but political emissaries for the Oligarchy are known to be seated in the halls of the larger cities behind the mountain peek.

## The Duchy of Shrinevalley
Situatied in the central region of Cease-Shrine amongst rolling green hills and vast open planes is the terrirtory of [[Duke Wilem IV]]. The Duchy of Shrinevalley is a mixed collection of former merchant city-states the swore allegiance to the [[Duke Wilem II]] amid high tensions with the [[Places/Cease-Shrine/Lineage of Proudmantle/Main Info | Proudmantle Lineage]].

Shrinevalley serves as a diverse mixing of cultures from either end of Cease-Shrine, and also as a political mediator when necessary. Maintaining a mostly open-market for commerce and political nuetral stance in current conflicts has serves Shrinevalley folk, mostly of human descent, well in it's time. That said pressures from both sides are mounting for the Duke to accept more *favourable* treatment to and from either end of the continent. 

Still, gentle coo's or brash threats have been unadressed by the gardened palace of [[Places/Cease-Shrine/Duchy of Shrinevalley/Cities/Gold Alter/Main Info | Gold Alter]] and the people live in reasonable comfort. 

## The Proudmantle Lineage
The Proudmantle Lineage is the largest of the three poltical provinces in Basilfall.  Ruled by the Goliath king [[Urush Proudmantle]], the lineage has turned into a sort of caesaropapism where Urush is hailed as a divine king that will restore Cease-Shrine to it's former greatness [[Time/Before Fall | B.F.]]

Urush hasn't been seen publicly within or out of his realms in some time now, rumors of madness or other sickness have been circulating in the lands surrounding the royal grounds of the [[Places/Cease-Shrine/Lineage of Proudmantle/Cities/Mantlehold/Greyhall Cathedral | The Greyhall Cathedral]] in the costal capital of [[Mantlehold]]. Of course any emissaries from the Cathedral or devout worshippers of Urush deny any such claims.

Nonetheless the Lineage's expansion east towards the Duchy have slowed to a near halt, much to the relief of the more eastern territories.
