## Basilfall was once the champion realm of divine making.
---
The myriad gods viewed it favourably, and their champions often performed their mighty deeds therein. Peoples were united in a golden age that seemingly lasted an eternity, and evil and corruption, while still present, were kept at bay more than aptly.

## But nothing will last forever.
Despite even the best wishes of the earliest of the divine overseers of mortal planes. And thus, division slowly set in. First among the Elves, who became either prideful and lofty, cutting of their realms from those they deemed of lesser culture, or paranoid and reclusive, escaping to the woodlands and mountains. Then fell the clan of dwarves, who became jaded and bitter of those outside of their mountain keeps. Albeit some more tame in the rolling hills of the south remain friendly to outsiders, though at arms length.

The reasons for the hiding Gnomes and Halflings is almost at this point lost to history, but nonetheless they are scant seen in the world at large anymore.

Then fell the settlements of men, who up until this time had enjoyed a blissful accord with the other races, due to their kind heart, loyalty and devotion to those they favoured. But even the strongest of walls can't hold a house aloft on its own.

## In a sense, humankind grew to use to their own company.

They spread quickly, and became wary of other kins and kiths who seemingly thought themselves better than the most mortal race of men, or suspicious of those who seemed to hide away from otherwise honest business or inquiry.

Corruption breeds well in division and xenophobia, and so evils and malice grew more powerful and commonplace in parts of the continents of Basilfal. Darker and more alien entities crept in and grew in power, and people more calloused and cruel.

## Thus, the tempers of the Gods changes in Basilfall.

Some forsook the plane altogether, and their worship decreased or even died out and were lost of the tides of time. Others seek to restore some of what was lost in the division of the world, to usher in a dawning age of order and harmony once again. But, more still from even farther planes than even the depths of the hell-lands see it as a chance to take control for themselves, and use the realm for their own will and fancy.

## For good or for ill Basilfall has changed.

And it shall never be as it once was again.
