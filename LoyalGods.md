# Most gods may have abandoned Basilfall
But some remained, whether sparsely involved or consistently loyal to their worshippers. Even still, some memory of the dieties that have abandoned the world remain in scattered corners of the various societies.

New gods from unknown origins have appeared here or there too, though have been met with some suspicions. Whether they are to be trusted at their word is dubious, though some zealots exist to do their bidding at all times. Whether these be celestial heroes or otherwise, they're presence among the continents is spreading

Some, like the [[Places/Cease-Shrine/Lineage of Proudmantle/Main Info | Proudmantle Lineage]], have banned worship of all gods but their own. Others *allow* the worship of other dieties, but discourage it heavily. 

Here listed are the currently known gods of Basifall:

## Loyal Gods
### The Prime Mother
Laylarian, The Prime Mother, is the naturefull Goddess of Basifall.  All things carnal from farming or sailing, to smithing and mining are under her watch.  She cares much for beauty and craftsmanship, but also for rural areas that haven't fallen prone to industrial excess. 

She is known to take many forms, but as her name implies, often takes the form of a noble matron or other motherly figure worthy of respect.

Laylarian has found most of her worship among eleven kin and humans who work with their hands. She is viewed as benevolant and protective of her children, earn her ire and your life will be less than pleasant nor even long-lived.

### The Sky Sword
Astrus, the mighty Sky Sword, is the defence of all mortal realms, including Basilfall. He is a brave and stalwart warrior against all threats of excess and carnal pleasure. He is the patron of pliticians and lawmakers, due to his care for balance and reason in scoiety, but also has dominion over soldiers and warriors who brave the fronts of battle to defend the helpless. 

Astrus ocassionally presents himself as a scout, or travelling solider, with known short brown hair and emerald green eyes. He does his work nobly and seeks no more acclaim than is deserved of him.

The Sky Sword hs much worship amongst Goliath, or any kin of just or brave temperment. He protects all in need, however, regardless of their reverence towards him. Fall into greed, corruption, or turn to opression and slavery, however, and you may just feel the edge of his Solaran Blade on your neck as it removes your head. 

### The Tome Keeper.
Stercian, the Tome Keeper, is the arcane diety of knowledge, luck, and magic in the world of Basilfall. Most libraries and scriptoriums are actually held inside or adjacent to many of their temples or monastaries. They have dominion over Teachers and Guildmasters, people that help pass knowldge down from sage to acolyte. Stercian also keeps charge of monks, hermits, or others who have dedicated thier life to the search of knowldge and understanding. Or those who just need a lucky find or a break into their craft.

The Tome Keeper has never been seen in any sort of mortal form to date, but has been known to present himself as an old book or scroll that held that essentially piece of knowlede you were looking for, never to be found again, or as a timely letter from someone or other who has just what you need to hear to tell you. 

Stercian's main worshipers were well known to be of halfling ilk when they were more common, though some forested elf settlements or hill-dwelling dwarf clans do have a partiality to their ways too. The ever curious race of man also have a large presence among the Tome Keeper's worshipers as their kingdoms expand. 


## Outer Deities.
The Outer Deities are a new and mysterious cohort of beings that often manifest through cultic worship.  As Such, not many are known by name, and those that are known are often shrouded in rumour or hysterical ravings.

## Setian. 
The entity that common presents itself as Setian is known to have tempted many a archmage to insanity. Promises of hidden arcanum or secret knowledge worthy only of the oldest of the gods are often on it's tongue.

Worshippers are known to be paranoid of any that seek to share the hidden or attempt to understand the mysterious.
